 * The completion item provider interface defines the contract between extensions and

 *
 * When computing *complete* completion items is expensive, providers can optionally implement
 * the `resolveCompletionItem`-function. In that case it is enough to return completion
 * items with a [label](#CompletionItem.label) from the
 * [provideCompletionItems](#CompletionItemProvider.provideCompletionItems)-function. Subsequently,
 * when a completion item is shown in the UI and gains focus this provider is asked to resolve
 * the item, like adding [doc-comment](#CompletionItem.documentation) or [details](#CompletionItem.detail).
 *
 * Providers are asked for completions either explicitly by a user gesture or -depending on the configuration-
 * implicitly when typing words or trigger characters.
